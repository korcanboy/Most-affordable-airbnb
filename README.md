# Most-affordable-airbnb
Using Machine Learning concepts, I was able to run a short program to find the most bang for your buck room 
Side notes:
- this was me practicing basic ML concepts (k-nearest neighbors algorithm) and getting familiar with pandas,matplotlib,numpy and scikit
- this isn't the best code as I was only able to use one feature for this program.
